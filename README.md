## üîç Refocusing App with Depth from Focus/Defocus

- Developed an interactive image refocusing application using a focal stack of images to simulate depth-aware focusing in real-time.  
- Created a focus measure algorithm based on the Modified Laplacian to generate a pixel-wise depth index map, with smoothing and vectorization for improved accuracy and performance.
